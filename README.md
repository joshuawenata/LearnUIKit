- UIView: The base class for all UI components in UIKit. It represents a rectangular area on the screen.
- UIViewController: Manages a single screen's worth of content in your app. Every screen typically has its own UIViewController.
- Layouts: UIKit uses Auto Layout to manage the positioning and sizing of views. Constraints define how views relate to one another.
